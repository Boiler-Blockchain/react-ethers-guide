# Ethers.js & React Example

This is a simple example project demonstrating how to interact with a smart contract using Ethers.js and React.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Boiler-Blockchain/react-ethers-guide.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```
cd react-ethers-guide
npm install
```


## Usage

1. **Start the development server:**

```
npm run start
```

2. **Open your web browser:**
Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Connect Wallet

Click on the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your wallet.

## Set/Get Value

- Enter a value in the input field and click on the "Set" button to set the value in the smart contract.
- Click on the "Get Value" button to retrieve the current value from the smart contract.

## File Structure

### Contracts

- **Example.sol:** This file contains the Solidity smart contract code for the example contract used in the project.

### src

- **contracts:** This folder contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the deployed smart contract. It is used by the front end to interact with the contract.

- **constants.js:** This file contains the address of the deployed smart contract. If you make changes to the contract and redeploy it, you need to update the address here.

- **App.js:** This file contains most of the application logic and frontend code. It includes state variables for the application (`provider`, `connectedAddress`, `contractValue`) and functions to connect the wallet and interact with the smart contract (`connectWallet`, `callContractFunction`). The HTML structure of the website is defined in the return function.

### Ethers.js Documentation

### Styling

Styling for the project is done using Tailwind CSS. You can learn how to use Tailwind CSS [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app).
